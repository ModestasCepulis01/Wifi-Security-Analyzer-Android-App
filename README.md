# Wi-Fi Security Analyzer App

## What's This App?
I made this app while learning more about Kotlin and Android Studio. It's a tool that helps you see Wi-Fi networks around you, showing you all sorts of info about them. 

It's great for anyone curious about their Wi-Fi's details or wanting to check how safe their network is.

## What It Does
- **Finds Wi-Fi Networks**: Shows you all the Wi-Fi networks you can connect to.
- **Shows Network Info**: Tells you the network's name (SSID), MAC address (BSSID), how strong the signal is, and what Wi-Fi types it supports.
- **Checks Security**: Helps you understand if the network is safe to use.
- **Gives More Details**: For those who like to know more, it also shows stuff like if the network supports Passpoint, its frequency, and channel width.

## Why I Made It
I wanted to get better at making apps with Android Studio and learn more about how Wi-Fi works. This app was a fun way to do both. I'm planning to add more to it as I learn more.

## What's Next?
I'm looking forward to making the app even better. If you've got ideas or want to help out, let me know!
